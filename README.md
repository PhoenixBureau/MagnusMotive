Large Flying Buildings
=============================

First of all, what are we talking about?

- Large: several kilometers or even larger.

- Flying: they spend most or all of the time in the air.

- Buildings: containing people and infrastructure.

How do we make them?  There are two areas to address:

- The methods of manufacturing them.

- The path from here & now to full production and deployment.


What's in this Repo
-----------------------------

- The `geometry` dir contains source code (OpenSCAD) and STL files for
  the geometric models.
- The `website` dir has ReST files which are converted to HTML via
  Pandoc.
- The `docs` dir is actually the content served by https://phoenixbureau.github.io/MagnusMotive/
  GitHub seems to have that name hard-coded (I would have preferred
  "htdocs" but it's not important.)  The important thing to know is that
  it's not the documentation for the repo.
- The `docs/images` dir contains images generated from the geometry
  files.
