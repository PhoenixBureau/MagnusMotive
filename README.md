First of all, what are we talking about?

- Large: several kilometers or even larger.

- Flying: they spend most or all of the time in the air.

- Buildings: containing people and infrastructure.

How do we make them?  There are two areas to address:

- The methods of manufacturing them.

- The path from here & now to full production and deployment.
