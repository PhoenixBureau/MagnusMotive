<p>Okay, the story so far...</p>
<p>There is a very simple and elegant language (or just notation) that can be defined as "Joy in the Continuation-Passing Style". I've written a type-inference and -checking system for it, and integrated it in the UI so that the user can only execute commands that type-check with the current contents of the stack. When new commands are defined (by making new Joy code) they are type-checked to make sure they have no internal inconsistencies and invalid definitions are rejected.</p>
<p>So, a simple, elegant, Turing-complete notation, that is easy to use and understand while being sophisticated in structure. (For example, high-level abstract discussion of recursion is much simpler in Joy than "Squiggol".)</p>
<p>Now that I have this solid base, I'm using e.g. "Structure and Interpretation of Classical Mechanics" by Gerald Jay Sussman and Jack Wisdom, to implement physical modeling software on an elegant (Clifford Algebra) computationally rigorous foundation. (Of course, leveraging Numpy and Sympy and all the rest.)</p>
<p>Overall, my emphasis now has to shift from implementation of the system itself to developing applications for the system. When I say "applications" here I'm using the word in the older, original sense, I want to apply the system to specific domains to evolve a powerful core of capabilities. There aren't separate "Apps". This process will also round out the rough edges in the UI.</p>
<p>There are a few things on the list still to do on the base system: it should have logging I think; all work is saved in a git repo but there's currently no in-system way to view or "pull" from the history, (a facility I call "backtime" in analogy to the "backspace" key); you should probably be able to edit more than a single text file; etc.</p>
<p>I'm really encouraged by the possibilities of "Categorical" programming. Conal Elliott's "Compiling with Categories" shows that I'm not barking up the wrong tree there. In effect, the same Joy code can be run in different categories to get different (valid!) computations. My inferencer is basically doing exactly that: it evaluates expressions in a "category" of stack-effect-comments (like in Forth) and type variables, and the same Joy code delivers the stack effect of that code, rather than the normal calculation that the normal interpreter would perform. As if that were not awesome enough, one of the categories will deliver Verilog code for the Joy code! I haven't implemented that category yet but of course it's on the list! And of course this also points the way to Joy compilers (to C or asm or whatever!)</p>

<p>So not too long ago, maybe a month, a paper went by on HN about writing compilers in Prolog. It was written by the same David Warren for whom the Warren Abstract Machine was named. It turns out researchers have been investigating compiling and code generation using Logical Paradigm code.</p>
<p>When I was implementing the type inference for Joy in Python there was a point when I realized that I should probably switch to Prolog or miniKanren if I really wanted to do anything weird, like propagate constraints or something. That, plus reading the paper, got me to reimplement Joy in Prolog.</p>
<p>Joy in Prolog turns out to be very elegant. Now I have a kind of interpreter in Prolog. It's also a stack effect inferencer due to the way Prolog works. I didn't realize this at first. I implemented the interpreter, then I implemented the type inferencer and only then realized that it was essentially identical to the interpreter. In hindsight, it's a little obvious.</p>
<p>Compiling is coming along. "Basic blocks" of simple functions are easy, I think compiling branches will be easy, dunno about loops and recursion.</p>

<p>I've embedded Joy into Prolog. That's a Pure, Functional interpreter inside the Logical Paradigm powerhouse. I /could/ present it as "the thing" and wrap prolog predicates in Joy functions and just say "It's Joy, now with logical programming too!" Or I could just use Joy as a tool inside Prolog that helps with partial evaluation and efficiency (by compiling to lower-level specialized code.)</p>
<p>I was convinced I would be maintaining my own fork of Python 2 (in the wake of Python 3), but since playing with Prolog I've adopted a personal rule, to wit: Always use the /highest-level/ language you can, and only "drop down" to a lower-level language when you really have to for some reason. Typically efficiency. The other biggie being ease of expression, but I think you should find ways to express your solutions in a higher-level language. Ways that are elegant and that translate automatically to good low-level constructs (ASM or LLVM Intermediate Representation or WebASM or wahtever.)</p>
<p>It turns out that there is a steady trickle of research into compiling with Logical Paradigm compilers going right back to David Warren [Warren1980]. The last chapter of "The Art of Prolog" is a presentation of a compiler for a simple Pascal-like language.</p>
<p>I think I see a very interesting and viable replacement (for Python, for me) in this setup: Prolog+Joy+Compiler. This gives you Logical Paradigm, a superior Functional Paradigm interpreter, and a path to Imperative Paradigm assembly code, in one elegant package. It's powerful, concise, expressive, ...I could just heap up the adjectives.</p>
<p>You can take a Joy expression, evaulate it in Prolog/Joy to figure out e.g. how many variables it expects on the stack, then transfer the expression to Python/Joy, preloading the stack with Sympy symbolic variables, then evaluate again to get Sympy symbolic result objects. Sympy can convert these into optimized low-level functions that can work efficiently with e.g. Numpy arrays, etc. I've tested this out and it works fine. It's simple "compilation" that I can do today and that gives a pretty decent payoff "out of the box".</p>
<p>I'm really at the stage now where I'm filling in details and fleshing out the UI and the applications. I don't really need a compiler (yet) but I'm probably going to work on it a bit more this week anyway. I mostly have to read up on the existing research and then just apply it. Prolog is so fucking elegant that it's easy to write this stuff once you get the hang of it. (I feel really stupid that it has taken me so long to get back to Prolog. A friend tried to turn me on to it like two decades ago. Better late than never!) Already writing code in ol' Python seems hopelessly crude. I feel like I've suddenly morphed into Dr. McCoy in the "Save the Whales" Star Trek movie (#4, still the best IMHO. Although You can't beat Christopher Loyd's Klingon Captain Kral!) when he's in the hospital. "Dr. gave me a pill and I grew a new kidney!"</p>

<p>This Prolog thing has thrown me for a bit of a loop. It's a good one though.</p>
<p>I have spent so much time with the Python version of Joy that it feels weird to be so ready to basically abandon it. This is driven in part by the death of Python 2 and my antipathy towards Python 3. I had thought I would maintain my own fork of Py2 but it would also make sense to migrate to an entirely different language/ecosystem. If I have Prolog for the Prologgy bits, and Joy for the imperative bits, and Prolog gives me a viable path to the metal, then do I really need Py2 anymore? Of course I'd keep in for easy access to all the cool software already written for it. But part of the old Xerblin idea was to engulf and digest existing software.</p>
<p>I want to stay in the logical paradigm as much as possible and only "drop down" when necessary for efficiency or expressiveness. (E.g. Dancing Links and SEQUITUR algorithms.) Even then it would be great to have high-level descriptions that are then compiled to correct low-level code. There are three methods of "compiling" I've identified so far:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Using an actual compiler written in Plg or Py2,</li>
<li>using Sympy to generate "lambdafied" versions of symbolic expressions,</li>
<li>and writing a Joy-to-Factor converter and using Factor-lang's native compilation facility.</li>
</ol>
<p>Probably gonna wanna use all three plus some others.</p>
<p>I have a hunch that partial evaluation might work best in Joy, although it might be superfluous if Plg delivers all the needful info automatically already.</p>
<p>I have to re-evaluate my priorities and goals a little. It feels a little like Yak Shaving to spend the next week learning to write a compiler in Prolog. Do I really need it right now? Plg partial reduction using clause() is great and powerful, but I don't think the efficiency of the Joy interpreter is an issue at the moment. A Joy-to-Factor translator written in Plg would probably be a much faster route to native binary code, but rolling my own (compiler in Plg) would take about as long and I would understand the output better and could re-target it to e.g. LLVM IR or WebASM. I think a Joy-to-Python or Joy-to-Cython compiler written in Plg would be better along a few dimensions: more interesting and accessible to a larger audience, is that it? I thought I had more. Maybe Factor is the way to go? Eventually I'll do both but which, if either, is needed right now?</p>
<p>The other thing to work on would be the UI. Evan C.'s Functional Reactive Programming model seems perfect (Elm-lang.)</p>
<h1 id="august-30">August 30</h1>
<p>I implemented an assembler for the Wirth RISC in Prolog. It was very easy, only took a few hours, mostly due to the simplicity of the processor and its instruction set. Having a parser already, I implemented the first code-generation pattern from the Oberon compiler chapter to kind of explore and see what it's like. Again, with Prolog this is relatively easy, so by the end of the day I had a "compiler" that could handle variable allocation and assignment statements that consist of assigning a constant value to a single (module-)global variable.</p>
<p>Already there were things that I don't necessarily want to deal with right away, like encoding floats to/from binary, and dealing with negative integers (Although I do handle branches to earlier labels so you can jump backwards, i.e. loop.) But it has let me grasp how compilers are both such an extraordinary improvement on assemblers, yet also so lodged in the past. They enshrine decisions made in the dawn-time and so encumber us today with misshapen abstractions that do more harm than good now that Moore's law has rescued us from tiny machines (with tiny machines.)</p>
<p>It's also led me to realize just how different the stack-based model of Joy is from the quasi-Turing Machine of the RISC CPU. For example, in Joy branches and loops expect a Boolean value on the stack, while in the RISC we instead have special "flag" bits in the chip which are un/set as side-effects of e.g. subtraction, etc. Implementing the Joy semantics directly would mean copying out the flag bit(s) of interest to a register (presumably the Top of Stack "cell" would be a register in any given Joy implementation, although that's not strictly necessary) every for every branch and loop iteration! Bad for efficiency, eh?</p>
<p>This implies that any real Joy-to-ASM compiler should be able to "look inside" the predicate of an ifte or while combinator to see which flags are the ones to check rather than defining the Joy comparison ops to actually reify the flag to a Boolean value on the stack. This shouldn't be too hard, but the tricky bit is that in Joy anything could leave a Boolean for branch and loop combinators! In practice, this may all be moot: The Prolog compiler will likely be able to "factor out" most of the weirdness from any given, practically-useful, definition!</p>
<p>I already have a Joy-in-ASM interpreter for Wirth RISC that's very crude and incomplete but functional Writing enough "compiler" in Prolog to regenerate that code should give me a good idea what I'm about. And there's a lot of Forth code and information around compiling Forth that is useful. By the end of the weekend I should have some Joy code that is getting compiled to RISC ASM and drawing things in the framebuffer of the simulator.</p>
