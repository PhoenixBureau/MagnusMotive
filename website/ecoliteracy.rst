Ecological Literacy
========================

May 2009

1) Time in Nature

   The basic unit of getting to know Nature is to spend time there.
   Quality time, meditating and observing nature. This will drive modern
   people wild as their systems jones for the stimulus of the artificial
   matrix they've grown accustomed to, but they must perservere.

2) Basic Ecology

   Once you can actually see the living beings in front of you, you can
   start to learn the natural history of the species, and how the plants
   and animals and fungus and microbes and everybody else live together
   and make life happen.  How the living beings, in pursuing each their
   own course, are cooperating in building a living cathedral of energy
   and matter to house the Divine.

3) Permaculture

   Once you have an appreciation of Nature and ecologic reality,
   grounded in both a "mystical" experience of the living reality of
   Nature and a scientifically informed understanding of the dynamic
   intricacies of its ongoing growth and life, you can start to "tweak"
   it.  Permaculture is the science of managing the ecosphere.  This is
   an incredible priviledge and a sacred duty.

4) Higher Scale Permaculture.

   Once you understand both the systems you're trying to cooperate with,
   you can appreciate larger scale ecological engineering. Permaculture
   can be practiced on the bioregional scale, but it requires a fractal
   understanding.  People throughout the region involved must be aware
   of what's going on around them.  


5) Ubiquitous Nature, Surplus as Status Quo, Minimal Architecture
