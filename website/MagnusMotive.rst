Magnus Motive
==============

The `Magnus effect`_ equation for lift says that the length, velocity,
and rotation contributions are linear, but that of the radius is squared.
E.g. a rotor of twice the radius will generate four times the lift.

The Magnus effect rotor is like a wheel for air, while the wing is like a sled-runner.

Applications
--------------------------------

- Toys
  - cardboard tubes and rubber bands
  - toy drones, kits

- Drones (non-toy)
  - litterbots
  - cargo
  - fire-brigade
  - survey
  - power generation
  - systems modeled on social insects

- Luxury Yachts
  - small batches and Unique
  - "New Age of Air"

- Heavy Lifters
  - very large (mile-wide) cellular design
  - million-person transport
  - permanent aerial structures


Toy Ideas
--------------------------------

#) A thin plastic disk that has flanges on both sides so you can attach two toilet paper tubes perpendicular to the disk (along its axis of rotation.) There would be a notch in the edge of the disk so you can lay a rubber-band in there and wind it around the tubes close to the disk to provide launch power.  One piece, could be printed, user supplies tubes (and maybe band?)

#) For paper towel tubes you could have a center plastic band slightly larger than the tube and about a centimeter wide, with a little hook for the rubber-band.  You would have end-caps that provide lateral stability.  Printable.

#) Small toy drones basically like regular toy drones except with tubes instead of propellers.  (Although a few propellers for thrust might work, many designs will rely solely on tubes.)

- The cardboard tubes and rubber bands toys are meant to:
  - spread the ideas and establish brand
  - sales to generate early income
  - inspire people

- The small toy drones:
  - allow for kids to enjoy more sophisticated machines
  - a path to real-world applications
  - rapid prototyping w/ low overhead
  - platform for Joy code/UI
  - tuning the software (both onboard and physics-sim-to-real-world mapping)
  
- Drones (large, automated but monitored in real-time)
  - cheap, robust, standardized, motor+rotor units
  - swappable battery backs, fuel cells


Simple Paper Towel Tube Toy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to play with the Magnus effect here's a simple toy you can
make:

You need:

- a cardboard tube from a roll of paper-towels
- a plastic lid from a coffee can or margarine tub or whatever
- a large rubber band or two

#) Stand the tube in the center of the lid and draw a circle around it with
   a marker.

#) Carefully cut slots in the center of the lid to form a kind of asterix
   shape.  The idea is to have "pizza slices" that will bend out and hold
   the tube when you push it through the center of the lid.

#) Push the tube through the center of the lid so that the cut
   triangle-wedges of the plastic lid bend and hold it in place.  Move the
   lid to the center of the tube and carefully balance the whole thing as
   best you can.  Then tape the plastic wedge fingers to the tube.

#) Cut a little rounded notch in the edge of the lid to catch the rubber
   band.
