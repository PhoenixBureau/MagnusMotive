The twelve verticies of an icosohedron form three Golden Rectangles.

(One disadvantage of this method is that the result will not have just
twelve verticies due to being formed from very thin blocks.  That can be
corrected in a different program.)

// The Golden Ratio of the long side to the short side is ~= 1.6180339...
phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2;


R = 0.00001;  // Very thin blocks.


module golden_rectangle(n) {
    // Create a Golden Rectangle with short edge length of n.

    // In order to take the hull() of the rectangles they must actually
    // be very thin blocks.
    cube([n, n * phi, n * R], center=true);
}

module rectangles(n) {
    // Create three Golden Rectangles and orient them into formation.
                        golden_rectangle(n);
    rotate([90, 90, 0]) golden_rectangle(n);
    rotate([90, 0, 90]) golden_rectangle(n);
}


// Take the hull() of the rectangles to get an icosahedron.  The short
// edge of the rectangles gives length of the icosohedron's edges.
hull() {
    rectangles(100);
}
// Comment out the hull() call to see just the rectangles.
